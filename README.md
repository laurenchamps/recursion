Recursion assignment for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion).

# Fibonacci
1. Using iteration, write a function fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this function should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
2. Now write another function fibsRec which solves the same problem recursively

# Merge sort
3. Build a function mergeSort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.

Run in node.
